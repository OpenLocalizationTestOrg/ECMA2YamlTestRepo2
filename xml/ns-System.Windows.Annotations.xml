## Remarks  
 Types in the System.Windows.Annotations namespace are provided to support the management of user-created annotations on application data displayed in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] document viewing controls.  Using the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_caf](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-caf-md.md)] applications can add support for user-created notes and highlights that are stored separate from the application document itself.  Since the user annotation information is stored separately from the document content, users can even add notes and highlights to read-only or rights-managed documents that cannot be physically changed.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] document viewing controls that support user-annotation capabilities are based on <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.DocumentViewerBase> derived subclasses such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DocumentViewer>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentPageViewer>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentScrollViewer> as well as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader>.
