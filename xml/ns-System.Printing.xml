## Remarks  
 This namespace contains the following core classes:  
  
-   The <xref:System.Printing.PrintSystemObject> class, which is the base class for the other core printing classes.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Printing.PrintServer> class, which represents an actual print server, usually a computer.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue> class, which represents an actual print queue and its printer.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Printing.PrintSystemJobInfo> class, which represents a particular print job.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> class, which instructs the printer how to process a print job.  
  
 Classes derived from the <xref:System.Printing.PrintSystemObject> class each have a <xref:System.Printing.PrintSystemObject.Commit%2A> and a <xref:System.Printing.PrintSystemObject.Refresh%2A> method. You must use these methods to ensure that instances of the classes are synchronized with the hardware or software components that they represent.  
  
 The System.Printing namespace also includes many enumerations that describe printer capabilities, such as whether a printer can produce collated output, and that specify instructions to printers, such as the paper size to use for a print job.  
  
 This namespace is part of the enhanced printing services provided with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)]. Managed code developers using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] must use the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)] in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing> namespace.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Classes within the System.Printing namespace are not supported for use within a Windows service or ASP.NET application or service. Attempting to use these classes from within one of these application types may produce unexpected problems, such as diminished service performance and run-time exceptions.
