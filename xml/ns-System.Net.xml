    <summary>The System.Net namespace provides a simple programming interface for many of the protocols used on networks today. The &lt;xref:System.Net.WebRequest&gt; and &lt;xref:System.Net.WebResponse&gt; classes form the basis of what are called pluggable protocols, an implementation of network services that enables you to develop applications that use Internet resources without worrying about the specific details of the individual protocols.  
  
 Classes in the System.Net namespace can be used to develop Windows Store apps or desktop apps. When used in a Windows Store app, classes in the System.Net namespace are affected by network isolation feature, part of the application security model used by the Windows Developer Preview. The appropriate network capabilities must be enabled in the app manifest for a Windows Store app for the system to allow network access by a Windows Store app. For more information, see the [Network Isolation for Windows Store Apps](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).</summary>
