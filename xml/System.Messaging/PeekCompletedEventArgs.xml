    <summary>Provides data for the <see cref="E:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted" /> event. When your asynchronous peek operation calls an event handler, an instance of this class is passed to the handler.</summary>

## Remarks  
 When you use event notification to peek (read without removing) messages asynchronously from the queue, you must create a method that handles your message processing. Your code must call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginPeek%2A> to begin the asynchronous processing. When a message is peeked, your application is notified through the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted> event. An instance of PeekCompletedEventArgs is passed into the event delegate that calls your event handler. The data associated with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted> event is contained in the delegate's <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.AsyncResult%2A> parameter.  
  
 There are two ways to provide notification of event completion: event notification and callbacks. PeekCompletedEventArgs is used only with event notification. For information comparing callbacks and event notification, see "Events vs. Callbacks" on MSDN.  
  
 PeekCompletedEventArgs provides access to the message that initiated the end of the asynchronous peek operation, through the <xref:System.Messaging.PeekCompletedEventArgs.Message%2A> member. This is an alternate access to the message, and behaves much the same as a call to <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates an event handler for the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted> event and associates it with the event delegate by using the <xref:System.Messaging.PeekCompletedEventHandler>. The event handler, `MyPeekCompleted`, peeks a message and writes its label to the screen.

## Remarks  
 AsyncResult identifies ongoing or completed asynchronous operations. The property contains data that helps determine which of several potential asynchronous operations to complete, and when passed to the event handler, enables <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A> to access the message associated with the completed operation.  
  
 When you call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginPeek%2A>, a <xref:System.IAsyncResult> is returned immediately, even though a message, if one exists, has not yet been retrieved because the operation is not completed. The AsyncResult indicates the state of the asynchronous operation. <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginPeek%2A> creates the object, which is modified throughout the operation until <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A> completes it.

## Remarks  
 The Message property provides a means for retrieving the message that initiated the end of the asynchronous peek operation.  
  
 <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is called the first time the Message property is read, so it is not necessary to call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A> prior to getting the value of this property.
