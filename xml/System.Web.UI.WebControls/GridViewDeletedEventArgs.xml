## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted> event when a Delete button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to "Delete") within the control is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control deletes the record. This allows you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine, such as checking the results of a delete operation, whenever this event occurs.  
  
 A GridViewDeletedEventArgs object is passed to the event-handling method, which allows you to determine the number of records affected and any exceptions that might have occurred. To determine the number of records affected by the delete operation, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.AffectedRows%2A> property. Use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Exception%2A> property to determine whether any exceptions occurred. You can also indicate whether the exception was handled in the event-handling method by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.ExceptionHandled%2A> property.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If an exception occurs during the delete operation and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.ExceptionHandled%2A> property is set to `false`, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control re-throws the exception.  
  
 If you want to access the name/value pairs of the key fields and non-key fields of the deleted record, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Keys%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Values%2A> properties, respectively.  
  
 For more information about handling events, see [NIB: Consuming Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/01e4f1bc-e55e-413f-98c7-6588493e5f67).  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the GridViewDeletedEventArgs object passed to the event-handling method for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted> event to determine whether an exception occurred during a delete operation.

## Remarks  
 Use the AffectedRows property to determine the number of records affected by the delete operation. This property is commonly used to verify that the correct number of records was deleted in the following situations:  
  
-   Verify that only a single record was deleted. Sometimes an improperly written delete statement can delete multiple records.  
  
-   Verify that a record was deleted when an error occurs during the delete operation that does not raise an exception.  
  
-   Verify that a record was deleted when a data source control that supports optimistic concurrency (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource> controls) has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource.ConflictDetection%2A> property set to the `ConflictOptions.CompareAllValues` enumeration value. Under this setting, a record that has been modified by another user concurrently might not be deleted.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the AffectedRows property to verify that a record was deleted during the delete operation.

## Remarks  
 When an exception is raised during the delete operation, use the ExceptionHandled property to indicate whether the exception was handled in the event handler. When this property is set to `true`, the exception is considered handled and is not re-thrown. If this property is set to `false`, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control re-throws the exception. To determine which exception was raised, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewDeletedEventArgs.Exception%2A> property.

## Remarks
